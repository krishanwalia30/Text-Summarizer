# Chicken Disease Classification Project

Chicken coccidiosis is a common intestinal disease caused by protozoan parasites from the genus Eimeria. Seven species of this genus can affect chickens, each with different pathogenic characteristics and targeting a specific intestinal location. The parasites rapidly multiply, damaging the intestinal lining, preventing chickens from absorbing nutrients from their food. Vaccination, preventative medication, and good flock management practices can help control the disease. 

**The disease is a major menace to the global poultry industry and hampers chicken's productivity and welfare.**

The aim of this machine learning project is to identify the disease of the chicken based on the fecal image of the chicken. The model can determine whether the chicken is infected with Coccidiosis or not, by just analysing the image of the fecal matter of the chicken.




## ‚öíÔ∏è Workflow

The workflow defines the way the components and pipeline is constructed in the project. The basic workflow followed in this project is as follows:

1. Update config.yaml
2. Update secrets.yaml [Optional]
3. Update params.yaml
4. Update the entity
5. Update the configuration manager in src config
6. Update the components
7. Update the pipeline
8. Update the main.py
9. Develop app.py
