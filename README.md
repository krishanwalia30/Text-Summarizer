# Text Summarizer Project

Text Summarizer takes a large document/paragraph and then uses an NLP model to generate a short paragraph.

This is a complete end-to-end Natural Language Processing machine learning project. APIs are developed for text summarization and training the model.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Workflow

The workflow defines the way the components and pipeline is constructed in the project. The basic workflow followed in this project is as follows:

1. Update config.yaml
2. Update secrets.yaml [Optional]
3. Update params.yaml
4. Update the entity
5. Update the configuration manager in src config
6. Update the components
7. Update the pipeline
8. Update the main.py
9. Develop app.py



## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

**Programming Language:** Python

**Packages used:** Pytorch, FastAPI, Transformers, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit, Scipy.

## üìö  Lessons Learned

* Learned to create an end-to-end machine learning pipeline.
* Created different modules and components for different stages in pipeline development.
* Learned about Transformers
* Learned about Hugging Face API.
* Integrated Hugging Face API within the project for accessing the dataset.
* Learned to use FastAPI.


## üßÆ Features

- Developed APIs
- Model can be trained from the webapp interface as well.
- Prediction API is also made on the webapp.
